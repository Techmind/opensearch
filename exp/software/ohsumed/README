# building scripts tested with python 2.6 (but I think it should work with 2.5)

# download filtering.tar.gz from http://trec.nist.gov/data/t9_filtering.html
# cp ohsumed.88-91 qrels.ohsu.88-91 query.ohsu.1-63 into this dir

# to generate ohsumed.flat and queries.txt
python etl.py
python etl_queries.py

# then can cd into any of the vertical search directories (i.e. lucene/) and follow its README
