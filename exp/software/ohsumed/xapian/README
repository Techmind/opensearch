# i was lazy here about doing Makefiles
# i overrode the existing index and search files in the Xapian examples dir

# in simpleindex.cc and simplesearch.cc change the file locations
# to point to wherever your ohsumed.flat and queries.txt are

# where you extracted Xapian might differ and require changing the dir location below
# from ohsumed/xapian dir

# no need to change the Makefile; just re-make

make

# remove any existing indices

rm -fr medindex
